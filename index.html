# Web traffic signs

### Description

Having (snapshots of) video recordings – captured via a Webcam or uploaded by a user – regarding an urban route (frequently/randomly) used by a person or a group of persons (e.g., by using a bike/car/bus), develop a (micro-)service-based Web system able to detect road/traffic signs. This detection process could be performed automatically by using specific public APIs and/or by using user-reported info (optionally, via external navigation services like [Waze or alternatives](https://alternativeto.net/software/waze/)). A specific ontology specified in OWL will be created. For each recognized (category of) road sign, a SPARQL end-point will offer various knowledge: meaning, type, legal regulations, relationships to other traffic signs, practical advices, context of use, comparisons, plus suggestions regarding user (driver/pedestrian) behavior. Consult the [Romanian Traffic Code](http://www.euroavocatura.ro/print2.php?print2=lege&idItem=1344) and [Comparison of European road signs](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Comparison_of_European_road_signs).
